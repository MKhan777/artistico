### `A bit Description`

In This project I have use mdbootstrap and react-bootstarp to design our app. I have used the dynamic rendering of cards in the events of any artist so that the event card is rendered dynamically based on the number of particular events any artist have wheather they are past events, upcomming or all events. I have also used gulp in our project to stream our build system (just used to compile css for initially). I have tried my best to
provide a workable solution in minimum time. Hope you like my project. I've also written
test cases for button to check if it renders correctly or not.
